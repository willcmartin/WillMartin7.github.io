         <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01528.pdf">The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning</a>
         (Terence Parr and Jeremy Howard, 2018)
      </div>
      <div>
        &emsp; A great resource that I have been using while building <a href="https://github.com/WillMartin7/pocketnet">pocketnet</a>.
        The authors start from the fundamentals and build their way to vector calc. and its use in backpropagation, gradient descent, etc.
